# systemd-boot-conversion

These scripts are a attempt to get Fedora to use systemd-boot on UEFI machines. Some scripts configure secure boot, some don't.
Some scripts use UKI, some don't.

**Be warned** this is all "in development" code, I am not responsible for bricking/breaking your install!

## Here be dragons!
These scripts have been put together by my in various states of management. It's very possible some are broken or have breaking bugs. You have, again, been warned. 
The non-UKI scripts might cause system breakages, see the [issues](https://github.com/sebastiaanfranken/systemd-boot-conversion/issues).
